    <summary>Image Classifier</summary>
    <div>
      <p>
        Worked on a Image Recognizing application to deteremine whether the given shate/image/pixel shape could be determined to be faces or numbers.It made use of the provided data and datalabels to learn about the patterns in an image to determine it. For simplicity, it used a preprocessed data points to help recognize patterns when the trained data and provided data was compared. Coded in Python, algorithm for the classifier was implemented through Naive Bayes theorem.

    <summary>Map Exploration</summary>
    <div>
      <p>
 An application that finds the most suitable or shortest route on a map/given grid (grid can be changed to a map by applying external API's for any given map that is compatible).Each grid is puzzled with a maze or certain road blocks that prolongs the track of the route,using A*(Astar algorithm and heuristic search) the application tries to find the most suitable route it can from the starting position to the target position(vice versa) continuously that helps determine the best route.Many of the address finding map applications use algorithms similar to this to generate the shortest path considering the better performance it provides through the use of heuristics.Coded in Java.
