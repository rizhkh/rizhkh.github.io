<projects i worked on LIST>
 <1><b> Email Alert/Reminder: </b> Developed a python application that sends email Reminders on a scheduled time slot - Targetted employees in offce environments where the use of smart phones is very limited and daily routine is highly dependant on schedule tasks and emails.
<br><br><br>
  
<2><b> Image Recognition: </b> Worked on a Image Recognizing application to deteremine whether the given shate/image/pixel shape could be 
 determined to be faces or numbers.It made use of the provided data and datalabels to learn about the patterns in an image to determine 
 it. For simplicity, it used a preprocessed data points to help recognize patterns when the trained data and provided data was compared.
 Coded in Python, algorithm for the classifier was implemented through Naive Bayes theorem.

<3><b> Map Search: </b> An application that finds the most suitable or shortest route on a map/given grid (grid can be changed to a map by applying
 external API's for any given map that is compatible).Each grid is puzzled with a maze or certain road blocks that prolongs the track 
 of the route,using A*(Astar algorithm and heuristic search) the application tries to find the most suitable route it can from the starting 
 position to the target position(vice versa) continuously that helps determine the best route.Many of the address finding map 
 applications use algorithms similar to this to generate the shortest path considering the better performance it provides through
 the use of heuristics.Coded in Java.

 <4><b> Automation: </b> [Tasked with an independent coding project at my internship] Developed a Python script that made use of the Selenium webdriver 
  API to automate the data entry process and simplify it. The script made use of the information provided on the excel spreadsheets and entered 
  the data into the UI database without any user help or supervision.

   <5><b> System Utility: </b> Designed a custom OS utility Malloc for memory allocation for the system,that supervised memory for proper
    distribution for various resources,programs etc. Implemented using C. 
   <br><br><br>

   <6><b> Remote client-server Application: </b> User to user application to send and receive messages and files, keeping IP logs and user
permissions of the users. Implemented using C.
   <br><br><br>

    <7><b> BitTorrent client: </b> TCP application to send and receive files in small data packets encrypted by a set of keys to
    ensure data integrity. Implemented using Python.
   <br><br><br>

       <8><b> Management System: </b> A terminal driven application for a local school that served as a management tool to record school data.
        The management system made use of permissions(admin roles,teacher roles) and allowed permissions to assign task,register classes,
        register new student information,class information,grades etc. Implemented using C++.
   <br><br><br>
        
     <9><b> Online retail skeletor (tried to mimic ebay): </b> Presented a user with a list of items to shop from,user registeration 
      and cart.It mimicked the ebay skeleton of 2004.User could edit their cart,add new items,delete off items from the cart,enter 
      information etc. Implemented using C++.

      <10><b> Online Database : </b> Worked with a group to design a website that would make use of a large database system(implementation MySQL)
       for a hotel's website for online registeration.This provided the hotel to have the capability to let thousands of new users to register,
       make online reservations whether it was a booking for a room for a vacation or two night stay,provided with other options like lunch and 
       dinner reservation,limo service etc. All information was saved on our cloud database (set up on AWS sre). Implemented using MySQL,Javascript,thymeleaf and springboot framework.

      <11><b> Music Player : </b> Developed a music player with a friendly graphical user interface that offers a user to create and edit a playlist of their own choice.Developed using JavaFX and Fxml.     

    <br><br><br>

      <12><b> Chess : </b> Designed a fully functional game of chess that allows two users to play against each other.Developed using Java.
